In my Capstone-Projekt for the Datascience Bootcamp of "Neue Fische" in Autumn 2020 I did an

            Analysis of global happiness in 2019
            
This analysis examines the following questions:
1. What is important for being happy?
2. How is happiness distributed in the world?
3. How good is the Happiness-score predictable by its features?

The question, which nation has the happiest people is examined and rated by the Global Happiness-Index.
The scores and rankings utilize information are from the Gallup World Survey. 
They are based on answers to the most life evaluation address, known as the Cantril-Ladder, 
asks respondents to think of a step with the most excellent conceivable life for them being a 10 
and to rate their claim current lives on that scale. The factors used to explain the score are

- GDP per capita
- Healthy Life Expectancy
- Social support (Family and nearest friends)
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity (Donations and Voluntary service)
- Corruption Perception (Trust in Government)

Please download the analysis if you want to use the interactive plots.

Have fun with it. Â¶
