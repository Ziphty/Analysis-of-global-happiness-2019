In my Capstone-Projekt for the Datascience Bootcamp of "Neue Fische" in Autumn 2020 I did an

            Analysis of global happiness in 2019
            
The analysis examines the following questions:
1. What is important for being happy?
2. How is happiness distributed in the world?
3. How well is the Happiness-score predictable by its features?

The question, which nation has the happiest people is examined and rated by the World Happiness Index since 2012. 
The life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings.
The scores and rankings are based on answers to the most life evaluation address, known as the Cantril-Ladder. 
The factors used to explain the score are

- GDP per capita
- Healthy Life Expectancy
- Social support (Family and nearest friends)
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity (Donations and Voluntary service)
- Corruption Perception (Trust in Government)

Please download the analysis if you want to use the interactive plots.

Have fun with it. Â¶
